1: What is Redux, and why is it used in React applications? Explain the core concepts of actions, reducers, and the store.
Ans:- Redux is a predictable state management library commonly used in JavaScript applications, including those built with React. It helps manage application state in a centralized, consistent, and scalable way. Redux is particularly useful in complex applications where multiple components need to share and interact with the same state.
Why Use Redux in React Applications?
Centralized State Management: Redux provides a single source of truth for the entire application state, making it easier to manage and debug.
Predictability: State changes in Redux are predictable because they follow strict rules enforced by reducers.
Ease of Debugging: Tools like Redux DevTools allow you to track every state change and action in your application.
Scalability: Redux helps manage state effectively in large applications with numerous components.
Core Concepts of Redux
1. Actions
2. Reducers
3. Store

2: How does Recoil simplify state management in React compared to Redux?
Ans:- Recoil is a state management library designed specifically for React applications. It simplifies state management by providing a more intuitive and React-friendly approach compared to Redux. Here's a breakdown of how Recoil simplifies state management compared to Redux:
1. No Boilerplate Code
2. React-Centric Approach
3. Granular State Management
4. Derived State with Selectors
5. No Middleware for Side Effects
6. Flexibility in State Scope
