Q.1 What is JavaScript. How to use it?
Ans:- 
JavaScript is a scripting language used to create and control dynamic website content, i.e. anything that moves, refreshes, or otherwise changes on your screen without requiring you to manually reload a web page. Features like:
animated graphics
photo slideshows
autocomplete text suggestions
interactive forms

Q.2 How many type of Variable in JavaScript?
Ans:-
JavaScript recognizes a few different types of variables: var, let, and const.

Q.3 Define a Data Types in js?
Ans:-
JavaScript has 8 Datatypes
1. String
2. Number
3. Bigint
4. Boolean
5. Undefined
6. Null
7. Symbol
8. Object

Q.4 Write a mul Function Which will Work Properly When invoked With Following Syntax.
Ans:-
The MUL function is a miniature of the multiplication function. In this function, we call the function that required an argument as a first number, and that function calls another function that required another argument and this step goes on. 
Syntax:

function mul(x) {
  return function (y) {
    return function (z) {
      return x * y * z;
    };
  };
}

Q.5  What the deference between undefined and undeclare in JavaScript?
Ans:-
Undefined: It occurs when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. Undefined is not a keyword. 

Undeclared: It occurs when we try to access any variable that is not initialized or declared earlier using the var or const keyword.

Q.15 What is the result of the expression (5 > 3 && 2 < 4)?
Ans:-  "True"

Q.16 What is the result of the expression (true && 1 && "hello")?
Ans:- The result is "hello", because all the operands are truthy, and the "&&" operator returns the last truthy operand.

Q.17 What is the result of the expression true && false || false && true?
Ans:- The result is false, because the "&&" operator has higher precedence than the "||" operator, so the expression is equivalent to ((true && false) || (false && true)), which returns false.

Q.18 What is a Loop and Switch Case in JavaScript define that ?
Ans:- JavaScript Loops are powerful tools for performing repetitive tasks efficiently. Loops in JavaScript execute a block of code again and again while the condition is true.
The switch statement evaluates an expression. The value of the expression is then compared with the values of each case in the structure. If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed. The switch statement is often used together with a break or a default keyword (or both).

Q.19 What is the use of is Nan function?
Ans:- NaN stands for "Not a Number" and is a value in JavaScript used to represent an undefined or unrepresentable value. NaN is the result of an operation that was supposed to return a number, but couldn't because of an error or undefined/empty value.

Q.20 What is the difference between && and || in JavaScript?
If you are using || the compiler checks left and right from this operator and it enough if min ONE side return true. If you are using a && operator BOTH sides have to be true (or false). By the way this concepts is also valid If you do have a chain of || or &&.


Q.21 What is the use of Void (0)?
Ans:-
The void operator evaluates an expression and returns undefined. By running void(0) in the URL JavaScript code, nothing is evaluated or returned.

Q.30 What are the looping structures in JavaScript? Any one Example?
Ans:-
JavaScript Loops are powerful tools for performing repetitive tasks efficiently. Loops in JavaScript execute a block of code again and again while the condition is true.
For example, suppose we want to print “Hello World” 5 times. This can be done using JS Loop easily. In Loop, the statement needs to be written only once and the loop will be executed 5 times as shown below:
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { 
    console.log("Hello World!"); }

• What is JavaScript?
Ans:-
JavaScript is a scripting language used to create and control dynamic website content, i.e. anything that moves, refreshes, or otherwise changes on your screen without requiring you to manually reload a web page. Features like: animated graphics. photo slideshows.


• What is the use of isNaN function?
Ans:-
isNaN() method returns true if a value is Not-a-Number.

• What is negative Infinity?
Ans:-
NEGATIVE_INFINITY is a special numeric value that is returned when an arithmetic operation or mathematical function generates a negative value greater than the largest representable number in JavaScript (i.e., more negative than -Number. MAX_VALUE) . JavaScript displays the NEGATIVE_INFINITY value as -Infinity .

• Which company developed JavaScript?
Ans:-
JavaScript was created at Netscape Communications by Brendan Eich in 1995.

• What are undeclared and undefined variables?
Ans:-
Undefined: It occurs when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. Undefined is not a keyword. 

Undeclared: It occurs when we try to access any variable that is not initialized or declared earlier using the var or const keyword. 


• Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?
Ans:-
document.createElement("<tagName>"); 
let newDiv = document.createElement("div");


• What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?
Ans:-
ViewState : View state can only be visible from a single page and not multiple pages.It will retain values in the event of a postback operation occurring.
SessionState : Session state value availability is across all pages available in a user session.In session state, user data remains in the server. Data is available to user until the browser is closed or there is session expiration.

• What is === operator?
Ans:- 
The strict equality (===) operator checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result. Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to be different.

• How can the style/class of an element be changed?
Ans:-
 Changing CSS with the help of the style property:
Syntax:
document.getElementById("id").style.property = new_style
Changing the class itself – We can use two properties that can be used to manipulate the classes.
The classList Property: The classList is a read-only property that returns the CSS class names of an element as a DOMTokenList object. 
Syntax:
document.getElementById("id").classList


• How to read and write a file using JavaScript?
Ans:-
readFile() and rs.writeFile() methods are used to read and write of a file using javascript. The file is read using the fs.readFile() function, which is an inbuilt method.
Syntax:
fs.readFile( file_name, encoding, callback_function )
writeFile() function is used to write data to a file in an asynchronous manner. If the file already exists, it will be replaced.
Syntax:
writeFile( file_name, data, options, callback )

• What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?
Ans:-
The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:
for statement
do...while statement
while statement
labeled statement
break statement
continue statement
for...in statement
for...of statement

• How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?
Ans:-
converting a string to an integer means transforming a string that represents a numeric value into an actual integer data type. This is useful when you need to perform arithmetic operations or comparisons on numeric values stored as strings.

• What is the function of the delete operator?
Ans:-
The purpose of the delete operator is to completely remove a property from an object, whereas setting a property to undefined just sets the property to undefined .

• What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?
Ans:-
JavaScript has three kind of popup boxes: Alert box, Confirm box, and Prompt box.

• What is the use of Void (0)?
Ans:-
It is used to prevent any side effects caused while inserting an expression in a web page.

• How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?
Ans:-
 you can force a page to load another page by using the window.location object. There are a few methods to achieve this. To force a page to load another page in JavaScript, we have multiple approaches:
Using window.location.replace
Using window.location.assign Property

• What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?
Ans:-
It is very slow because as inner HTML already parses the content even we have to parse the content again so that's why it takes time. When we have used the event handlers then the event handlers are not automatically attached to the new elements created by innerHTML.
